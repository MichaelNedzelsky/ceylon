doc "A string of characters. Each character in the string is 
     a 32-bit Unicode character. The internal UTF-16 
     encoding is hidden from clients.
     
     A string is a `Category` of its `Character`s, and of
     its substrings:
     
         `w` in greeting 
         \"hello\" in greeting
     
     Strings are summable:
     
         String greeting = \"hello\" + \" \" + \"world\";
     
     They are efficiently iterable:
     
         for (char in \"hello world\") { ... }
     
     They are `List`s of `Character`s:
     
         value char = \"hello world\"[5];
     
     They are ranged:
     
         String who = \"hello world\"[6...];
     
     Note that since `string[index]` evaluates to the 
     optional type `Character?`, it is often more convenient
     to write `string[index..index]`, which evaluates to a
     `String` containing a single character, or to the empty
     string \"\" if `index` refers to a position outside the
     string.
     
     The `string()` function makes it possible to use 
     comprehensions to transform strings:
     
         string(for (s in \"hello world\") if (s.letter) s.uppercased)
     
     Since a `String` has an underlying UTF-16 encoding, 
     certain operations are expensive, requiring iteration
     of the characters of the string. In particular, `size`
     requires iteration of the whole string, and `item()`,
     `span()`, and `segment()` require iteration from the 
     beginning of the string to the given index."
