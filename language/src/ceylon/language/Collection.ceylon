doc "Represents an iterable collection of elements of finite 
     size. `Collection` is the abstract supertype of `List`,
     `Map`, and `Set`.
     
     A `Collection` forms a `Category` of its elements.
     
     All `Collection`s are `Cloneable`. If a collection is
     immutable, it is acceptable that `clone` produce a
     reference to the collection itself. If a collection is
     mutable, `clone` should produce an immutable collection
     containing references to the same elements, with the
     same structure as the original collection&mdash;that 
     is, it should produce an immutable shallow copy of the
     collection."
